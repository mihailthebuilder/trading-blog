After a [superficial search](./pick-first-algo-trading-course) for the best algo trading tutorial, I arrived
at [this YouTube video](https://youtu.be/9Y3yaoi9rUQ) from [freeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org/), an organization
I'm very familiar with. The video was created by [Luke Hardy](https://www.youtube.com/@lachone_); his real name is [Lachezar Haralampiev](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lachezar-haralampiev-62ab11121/). But enough with the cyber-stalking and let's dive into the course!

The course starts with an overview of algorithmic trading, and the 3 projects that will be covered. The usual warnings - it's very hard to predict prices etc etc.

But wait! There's a nugget of information that I didn't know of - apparently **it's not so hard to predict volatility**. I'm skeptical so I look online for more on this. [This paper](https://saltfinancial.com/static/uploads/2021/05/The%20Laymans%20Guide%20to%20Volatility%20Forecasting.pdf) seems to corroborate the statement:

> Due to its autoregressive properties, even a simple 10-
> day historical standard deviation of returns can be a useful
> forecast of tomorrow’s volatility. If annualized volatility
> over this 10-day span is rather high at 32%, it is very likely
> tomorrow’s volatility will continue to be high
