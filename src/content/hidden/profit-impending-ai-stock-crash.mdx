I've stated in [my previous post](./invest-ai-stocks) that prices for AI stocks (Nvidia, ARM, and the likes) are bound to fall. So how can I profit from my brave prediction?

I know of 2 basic choices - [shorting selling](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/short.asp) and [put options](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/putoption.asp). But I'm wondering whether there are alternatives, so I ask the best financial advisor in the world - ChatGPT.

The all-knowing entity starts with the 2 strategies I already mentioned. For the short position, it encourages me to use a [stop loss](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stop-lossorder.asp), which makes sense.

1. A bear put spread, which is when you buy a put at a lower strike price and you sell another at a higher price; both on the same stock and the same expiration date.
2. A

3. Put option.
4. Shorting t

Well, there are 2 main options:

2. I buy a bear put spread.
