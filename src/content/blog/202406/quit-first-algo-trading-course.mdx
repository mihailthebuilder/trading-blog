After a [superficial search](./pick-first-algo-trading-course) for the best algo trading tutorial, I arrived
at [this YouTube video](https://youtu.be/9Y3yaoi9rUQ) from [freeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org/), an organization
I'm very familiar with. The video was created by [Luke Hardy](https://www.youtube.com/@lachone_); his real name is [Lachezar Haralampiev](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lachezar-haralampiev-62ab11121/). But enough with the cyber-stalking and let's dive into the course!

The course starts with an overview of algorithmic trading, and the 3 projects that will be covered. The usual warnings - it's very hard to predict prices yada yada.

But wait! There's a little nugget of information - apparently **it's not so hard to predict volatility**. I need to look into that more, maybe there are some instruments based on volatility measurements that I could potentially trade, like the [VIX](https://www.cboe.com/tradable_products/vix/).

Luke proceeds to the first project - an unsupervised learning trading strategy that uses [technical indicators](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/technicalanalysis.asp). We're doing a lot of data manipulation, but I'm already starting to feel demoralized for a couple of reasons:

1. I don't understand **why** technical indicators work. And I don't even know where to look for the answer.
2. There's a lot of Python code being written that I'm not familiar with. We're using libraries and methodologies that seem very specific to this strategy.

I feel like there has to be something simpler I could start with. I take a quick glance at the [older freeCodeCamp tutorial](https://youtu.be/xfzGZB4HhEE) that I saw on YouTube. It seems a lot more beginner-friendly. So I give up on this one for now and switch.
