I started looking online for my first algo trading course. As someone who's learned a lot of things on his own, I've acquired some preferences for what I want out of an introductory course.

Here are the top 3 things I look for:

1. The course has to be free. I'm not going to spend $500 only to realise that I don't enjoy the topic.
2. It needs to make me do something on my own ASAP. Professional football players don't start by reading books about the sport.
3. I need to understand why I'm doing whatever they're telling me to do. Just at a basic level.

Armed with those criteria, I ventured out on the web for the perfect intro course. I started by looking at what people recommend on Reddit. It's [mostly books](https://www.reddit.com/r/algotrading/comments/t6vqoa/any_advice_on_where_to_start/); the most famous one seems to be [Quantitative Trading by Ernest P. Chan](https://a.co/d/3DeOJly). I tend to be skeptical of books because they can easily become outdated.

So then I move to YouTube. I type `learn algorithmic trading` in the search bar, and I get a few courses. I spot that freeCodeCamp has a couple of courses - an [older one](https://youtu.be/xfzGZB4HhEE?si=BqcTO1L7ete2Pcqx) that lasts 4 hours,
and a [newer one](https://youtu.be/9Y3yaoi9rUQ?si=6fmZZAqzFl3Mqlkr) that's only 3 hours in length. I can't tell much between these two courses so I go for the newer one.

And so my journey begins.
