I'm a big proponent of passive investing. It all started
when I found [Ben Felix's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@BenFelixCSI);
I love how he uses empirical research to prove that the optimal investment strategy
is to buy a well-diversified index fund. Here's one such stat: 80% of US active funds
underperform their benchmark over a 3-year period; 93% in Europe ([source](https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/documents/spiva/spiva-infographic.pdf)).

So why the hell am I bothering? The boring, honest answer: I'm quite interested in the field and there's good money to be made. Let me elaborate on that for a bit.

I was a Mathlete in school, so I'm partial to numbers. I didn't expose myself much to finance in university, but
I remember fondly the few modules I took on derivatives, asset pricing, and statistics. And I often find
myself critiquing the research that guides product decisions in my [day job](./mihail-blog-introduction).

There are some personal traits that will probably be weaknesses in this field. I'm risk averse and tend to over-analyze things, for example. Which is why I'm focusing more on the learning journey.

I'd be lying if I said I wasn't tempted by the compensation potential either. Even if I fail in my trading quest, I could potentially settle
for a Quant Developer role that would enable me to [easily earn 6 figures](https://www.morganmckinley.com/uk/salary-guide/data/quant-developer/london). This is my only option for a well-paying permanent role as I just can't get myself motivated to grind Leetcode-style questions.

I'll leave you with a question - do you think all of this makes sense? [Send me a message
on LinkedIn](linkedin.com/in/mihailmarian/) if you have any advice - I'm totally oblivious about the field (for now!).
